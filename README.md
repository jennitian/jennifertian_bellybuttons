# Belly Button Diversity
Module 12 challenge

# Goals
To deploy a webpage where you can view the bellybutton bacterial diversity of anonymous participants sorted by abundance. From this data, we can see the range of diversity in this sample population and identify the most abundant species. The goal is to find species that make proteins that have a meat like aroma in hopes of finding alternatives to meat through lab grown proteins. You can also gather the frequency of belly button washing within this population.
